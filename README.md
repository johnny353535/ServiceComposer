==================

Note: Most of the actions will be performed via the console/command-line/terminal. You should be familiar with opening the console, traversing directories and running commands. If a command is failing try to run it as an administrator. To do this on Mac start the command with `sudo`.

## Components

- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) is the tool that does the dirty work for you. Compiling LESS files, concatenating and minifying JavaScript files, error checking and much more.

- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/), the Node Package Manager, is used to search, install and uninstall Grunt plugins.

- [Bower](bower.io) is used to search for, install and uninstall JavaScript and LESS/CSS frameworks and libraries used in front-end development (like jQuery, modernizr, HTML5shiv etc.).

## Initial setup

Windows users: Download and install [git](http://git-scm.com/). Pick "Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt" during install! To check whether it's installed properly open a command line window and type `git`.

- Download and install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) (`npm install -g grunt-cli`)
- Install [Bower](http://bower.io/#installing-bower) (`npm install -g bower`)

- Install the required Grunt plugins with `npm install`. If this fails run the command as an administrator.
- Install the required Bower plugins with `bower install`
- Run `grunt dev` to start working on the project

## Working with Grunt.js

To run a task use `grunt [task name]`. There are two default tasks available - *dev* and *dist*. They will be explained in the following.

### grunt dev: Development

The task used during development is called 'dev'. Run it with `grunt dev`.
It starts a static web-server with auto-reload enabled, compiles React files to JavaScript, compiles LESS files into CSS and checks JavaScript files for errors using [JSHint](http://jshint.com).

Once the task is running the page can be accessed via 'http://localhost:8080'

### grunt dist: Building a distribution ready version of the project

The task used to create a deployable version of the project is called 'dist'. Run it with `grunt dist`. It will export to the `dist` repository.

What it does:

- JavaScript-files get concatenated and minified using [r.js](https://github.com/jrburke/r.js), creating one file that contains all the code. The require.js library is being replaced with [almond](https://github.com/jrburke/almond), a minimal module loader that only contains the code necessary in production.
- The `<script>`-tag in the `index.html` is updated to include the generated `main.min.js` file.
- CSS gets automatically processed to include all currently necessary vendor-prefixes (i.e. -webkit-).


## Adding JavaScript and CSS libraries

Plugins, libraries and frameworks can either be installed using Bower or by hand.
To check whether a package is available on Bower check the [Bower website](bower.io/search/) or use `bower search [package name]`. If it's not available you have to install it by hand.

- Install Bower packages via `bower install [package name] --save`. The optional parameter `--save` tells Bower to save the package as a dependency of the project.
- Bower packages are only downloaded and placed in the `bower_components`-folder. To learn how to include them in your project check the next chapter.

For further information consult the [Bower website](http://bower.io/#usage).

Note: Bower packages should never be committed to version control, which is why their directories are excluded by the `.gitignore`.

### Including  packages

**JavaScript** libraries have to be added to the require.js-config file, which can usually be found at `js/main.js` ([link](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#usage)). To use it wrap your code in a `require`-block ([link](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#data-main)) or define a RequireJS/AMD-module ([link](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#define)). Reference either the source file in the `bower_components` directory or the `js/vendor` directory, depending on where you got it from.

For a more comprehensive introduction to RequireJS check out the [API docs](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html).

**LESS/CSS** libraries should be imported in the `style.less` file via `@import (inline) "[path]/[to]/[package].css"` (in case of LESS-files `(inline)` can be omitted). Reference either the source file in the `bower_components` directory or the `less/vendor` directory, depending on where you got it from.

### Bootstrap components

[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) is always installed. However, to use it the required components have to be referenced in the `less/style.less`-file, so they will be compiled into CSS. The location of the components is `bower_components/bootstrap/less`. You can find a list of all components on the [Bootstrap website](http://getbootstrap.com/components/). Bootstrap variables, normalize and mixins are added as a standard feature.

To use Bootstrap's variables you have to add your own `variables.less`-file and override the desired variables.

## Adding your own tasks to Grunt

To add your own tasks to Grunt you have to install the desired Grunt plugin with NPM and configure it with the `Gruntfile.js`.

- Find available Grunt plugins [here](http://gruntjs.com/plugis). Plugins with the `contrib-` prefix are maintained by the Grunt team.
- Install Grunt-plugins via `npm install [plugin name] --save-dev`. The optional parameter `--save-dev` tells NPM to save the plugin as a dependency of the project. The plugins are being installed into the `node_modules`-folder
- Make the plugin available in your Gruntfile via `grunt.loadNpmTasks('[plugin name]')`
- Consult the plugin's website for usage instructions

For further information consult the [Grunt website](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started).

Note: Grunt plugins should never be committed to version control, which is why their directories are excluded by the `.gitignore`.
